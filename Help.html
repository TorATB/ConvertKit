<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p>How do I extract audio from a video file?<br>
Right click the video file, Send to ConvertKit, choose the output file to be wav</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why is the Lossless in quotes?<br>
Not all formats support Lossless, so the formats that does not support it, will just have the Highest possible quality setting.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What formats does this support?<br>
Almost any formats are supported. I use FFMpeg and ImageMagick to convert the files, and they support alot of different formats! I have not added too many formats to the GUI though, to keep it as simple as possible.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I want to merge an audio file into a video file, can it do that?<br>
Yes, if you only select two files (one video and one audio), the application will check the length og the two files, and if they match, it will merge them to a new video file!</p>

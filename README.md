# ConvertKit

## Convert video, audio or images to other formats or compress or simple adjustments like rotate one or more files.

Convert video files (every video file that ffmpeg supports) to the following: MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, MKV, M2V, OGG, FLV (or extract audio to the following formats WAV or MP3)
Convert audio files (every audio file that ffmpeg supports) to the following: MP3, WAV, FLAC, WMA or OGA
Convert images from various raw or normal formats to JPEG, PNG, TIFF, BMP, GIF, ICO.
You can also rotate video and image files. There is a simple "How to" guide, but I hope the application is so easy to use, that you will not even need it.
